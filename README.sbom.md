# SBOM Generation for SONiC Builds

A CycloneDX 1.6 Software Bill of Materials, an SPDX 2.3 conversion,
and an unsigned SLSA v1.0 provenance attestation are emitted alongside
every `target/sonic-<machine>.bin` when the build is invoked with
`ENABLE_SBOM=y`. Default builds are unaffected.

## Quick start

Enable for one build:

```bash
make ENABLE_SBOM=y target/sonic-broadcom.bin
```

Output, alongside the `.bin`:

```
target/sonic-<machine>.bin                  installer image
target/sonic-<machine>.bin.cdx.json         CycloneDX 1.6 SBOM (primary)
target/sonic-<machine>.bin.spdx.json        SPDX 2.3 (when SBOM_FORMAT in spdx, both)
target/sonic-<machine>.bin.intoto.json      unsigned SLSA v1.0 provenance
```

Test containers that get built but don't ship in any `.bin`
(`docker-ptf`, `docker-ptf-sai`, `docker-sonic-mgmt`) each get a
standalone sidecar SBOM:

```
target/docker-ptf.gz.sbom.cdx.json
target/docker-ptf-sai.gz.sbom.cdx.json
target/docker-sonic-mgmt.gz.sbom.cdx.json
```

Generate a vulnerability report from the SBOM (a standalone post-build
step, not part of the build):

```bash
python3 scripts/sbom_vuln_scan.py target/sonic-broadcom.bin.cdx.json
# Writes target/sonic-broadcom.bin.vuln.json + prints a table.
# Add --vex vex/ to apply suppressions. --fail-on critical for CI gating.
```

The SBOM is *not* embedded inside the `.bin`. Release engineering
publishes the sibling files alongside it.

## Configuration

| Variable | Default | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `ENABLE_SBOM` | `n` | Master switch. When `n`, no SBOM hooks fire and no extra tools are installed. |
| `SBOM_FORMAT` | `both` | `cyclonedx`, `spdx`, or `both`. SPDX is a downstream conversion via `cyclonedx-cli` (auto-fetched), so emitting both is essentially free — but the conversion carries **no dependency relationships** and no `formulation`, so the containment graph exists only in the CycloneDX document. |
| `SBOM_SCAN_TOOL` | `syft` | Binary scanner for transitive deps: `syft` or `trivy`. |
| `SBOM_INCLUDE_LICENSES` | `y` | Whether to harvest copyrights and resolve SPDX licenses. |
| `SBOM_STRICT` | `y` | When `y`, the build fails if a critical SBOM input is missing — host rootfs (`fsroot-<machine>/`), any `.gz` in `SBOM_INSTALLER_DOCKERS`, or the scanner binary — and also if the finished document fails schema validation or its dependency graph does not resolve. Set to `n` for debugging or one-off partial emits. Soft optional features (SPDX conversion, provenance, license resolution) always warn-and-continue regardless. |

These variables are surfaced in the `Build Configuration` dump that
SONiC prints at the start of every build, so you can confirm the state.

## Scope

Two SBOM kinds are emitted, with different scopes:

**The aggregate `.bin` SBOM** (`target/sonic-<machine>.bin.cdx.json`)
covers what ships on the DUT inside the installer payload: the host
root filesystem, the kernel + every shipped module, the bootloader,
and every container the build packaged into the `.bin`. Build slaves,
the SDK build environment, and any container gated by an `INCLUDE_*`
flag set to `n` are automatically excluded — the aggregator reads the
docker list `slave.mk` itself computed for the active `PLATFORM`, no
hand-curated allow-list.

**Per-container sidecar SBOMs** (`target/<container>.gz.sbom.cdx.json`)
are emitted for test containers that get built but don't ship in any
`.bin` and so wouldn't otherwise be represented:

- `docker-ptf`, `docker-ptf-sai` — PTF test harness
- `docker-sonic-mgmt` — automation harness

These exist so security tooling has a CycloneDX surface for them
distinct from the production `.bin` SBOM. The other ~30 in-scope
containers don't get a sidecar — they're already covered by the
aggregate `.bin` SBOM.

When you enable an optional container (`INCLUDE_PDE=y`, etc.) it
ships, so it appears in the `.bin` SBOM. The filter tracks the
build's own opt-ins.

Always out-of-scope (never gets any SBOM):

- `sonic-slave-*` build slave images.
- `docker-sonic-sdk-buildenv` (SDK build environment).
- Build-time-only debs and wheels (`_TEST = y` recipes, build deps
  that `apt autoremove` strips before `fs.squashfs` is sealed).

## Architecture

Four independent sources contribute components to the final SBOM,
merged in priority order (first source wins for any given component):

```
+----------------+      +----------------+      +----------------+      +----------------+

|                |      |                |      | not lockfile.) |      |                |
+----------------+      +----------------+      +----------------+      +----------------+
        |                       |                       |                       |
        +-----------------------+-----------------------+-----------------------+
                                            v
                                +-----------------------+
                                |  Merge (purl + nva +  |
                                |  normalized-version)  |
                                +-----------------------+
                                            v
                            target/sonic-<machine>.bin.cdx.json
```

**Why hybrid.** Recipe-driven emit owns the locally-built artifacts
(versions, submodule SHAs, patch series, per-.deb Rust/Go/Python
language-dep attribution) that a binary scanner has no way to recover.
Observation owns transitive apt/pip deps. Lockfile parsing adds the
language-ecosystem transitive deps in ecosystems the per-.deb
introspection above doesn't already cover. Scanner is the wide net
for anything else. None of the four alone is complete; the union is.

**Dedupe by `(purl, name+version+arch, name+normalized-version+arch)`.**
The normalized-version key strips Debian epochs (`1:`) and downstream
suffixes (`+fips`, `+sonic`, `+bN`, `+debNuM`) so recipe-emit's
a recipe-emit `<pkg> <upstream-ver>` matches observation's `<epoch>:<upstream-ver>+fips`.
Legitimately distinct upstream versions of the same package across
different Debian releases stay distinct.

**Dynamic, not enumerated.** The recipe layer only fires when make
actually invokes that recipe; observation only sees what got
installed. Builds for different `PLATFORM` values produce different
SBOMs automatically because the build invokes different recipes.
`SONIC_VERSION_CONTROL_COMPONENTS` overrides (where pins float to
mirror-latest) are reflected too — observation records what was
actually installed.

## Component categories

How each pattern is captured. Concrete CycloneDX shapes are visible in
`target/.../*.cdx.json` after a build; one representative example is
shown after this list.

- **SONiC-native code** (sonic-net submodule). Primary PURL:
  `pkg:github/sonic-net/<repo>@<commit>`. `externalReferences` records
  the submodule URL and pinned commit. No pedigree unless a sibling
  `src/<pkg>.patch/` exists.

- **Patched upstream Debian sources** (`dget` + sidecar patches in
  `src/<pkg>/patch/`). Primary: `pkg:deb/sonic/<name>@<version>`.
  `pedigree.ancestors[0]` records the upstream Debian `.dsc` URL +
  MD5 from `versions-web`; `pedigree.patches[]` enumerates each
  applied patch with its SHA-256.

- **Forked upstream with nested submodule** (the FRR pattern:
  `src/sonic-frr` is a sonic-net wrapper holding patches; the nested
  `src/sonic-frr/frr` is FRRouting upstream). Primary:
  `pkg:deb/sonic/frr@<version>`. Ancestor:
  `pkg:github/FRRouting/frr@<git-describe>`. Patches + aggregate
  patch-set SHA-1 in pedigree. Same handling for sonic-p4rt,
  sonic-sysmgr (gnoi), wpasupplicant.

- **Direct upstream submodule with sidecar patches** (scapy, ptf,
  ptf-py3, supervisor, redis-dump-load). Primary derived from the
  artifact filename (PyPI for wheels, deb for debs). Ancestor:
  `pkg:github/<upstream-org>/<repo>@<git-describe>`. Patches from the
  sidecar directory.

- **Upstream apt/dpkg packages** (everything apt-installed into the
  rootfs or a container, ~1000+ debs). Captured by observation:
  `dpkg-query` against each scope. PURL form
  `pkg:deb/debian/<name>@<version>?arch=<arch>`. Mirror snapshot
  timestamp attached via `externalReferences.comment`.

- **Python packages.** Locally-built wheels and stdeb debs follow the
  SONiC-native or direct-upstream rules. PyPI installs in
  containers/rootfs are observation
  (`pkg:pypi/<name>@<version>`) from `pip3 freeze`. `uv pip` installs
  are caught by the scanner pass since uv writes standard
  `dist-info/` directories.

- **Docker container images.** One `type: container` component per
  shipped container with image digest. Per-container observation
  components nested under it via `dependencies[]`. Base image SHAs
  recorded from `files/build/versions/default/versions-docker`.

- **Kernel and out-of-tree modules.** Linux kernel built from Debian
  source + ~200 SONiC patches enumerated in pedigree. Each kernel
  module (`opennsl-modules`, `sx-kernel`, `ionic-modules`, every
  `sonic-platform-modules-*`) has a `dependencies[]` edge pointing
  at the kernel image's `bom-ref` so consumers can reason about
  kernel-ABI risk.

- **Vendor SDKs and HALs** (Broadcom SAI, Mellanox SDK, NVIDIA
  BlueField, Marvell Teralynx, Pensando, Arista PHY Credo). Recipe
  emits `type: library` with `supplier.name` derived from URL
  pattern, the EULA name as license, and a build-time-computed
  SHA-256.

- **Language-ecosystem transitive deps.** Per-scope `go.sum`,
  `package-lock.json`, `pnpm-lock.yaml`, `yarn.lock` are harvested by
  the build hook into `lockfiles.tar.gz`. Each entry becomes a
  `pkg:golang/` or `pkg:npm/` component with the SHA-256 from the
  lockfile preserved. Rust crate inventory is *not* harvested this
  way — see the next bullet.

- **Per-.deb language dependency attribution.** Every SONiC-built
  `.deb` is introspected at fragment-emit time
  (`scripts/sbom_fragment.py`). A single `dpkg-deb -x` extraction
  feeds three harvesters:

  - **Rust** — for each ELF, `rust-audit-info` reads the `.dep-v0`
    section that `cargo-auditable` embedded. Emits each crate as
    `purl=pkg:cargo/<name>@<version>` with
    `sonic:fragment_kind=recipe-emit-rust`.
  - **Go** — for each ELF, `go version -m` parses the
    `runtime/debug.BuildInfo` table from the `.go.buildinfo` section.
    Emits each module as `purl=pkg:golang/<module>@<version>` with
    `sonic:fragment_kind=recipe-emit-go`. Replacement directives
    (`=>`) are honored so the recorded version is what actually
    shipped.
  - **Python** — walk for `*.dist-info/METADATA` files and parse
    Name + Version. Emits each as `purl=pkg:pypi/<normalized>@<version>`
    with `sonic:fragment_kind=recipe-emit-python`. SONiC `.debs`
    today don't ship dist-info content (Python is staged via dpkg
    into `/usr/lib/python3/dist-packages/` without metadata), so
    Python attribution here is currently a no-op — but the harvester
    activates automatically as soon as a `.deb` recipe starts
    bundling a venv or installing wheels into `debian/<pkg>/`.

  Every emitted component carries `sonic:source_deb=<deb filename>`.
  `build_sbom.py:build_dependency_graph()` reverses
  `sonic:source_deb` into `dependsOn` edges from the `.deb`'s
  `bom-ref` to each language-dep component so a consumer can walk
  `swss_*.deb -> tokio@1.x` (Rust) or `sonic-gnmi_*.deb ->
  github.com/openconfig/gnmi@v0.10` (Go) directly without parsing
  properties.

### Example component (forked-upstream pattern after pedigree resolution)

```json
{
  "bom-ref": "pkg:deb/sonic/frr@<sonic-version>?arch=<arch>",
  "type": "library",
  "name": "frr",
  "version": "<sonic-version>",
  "purl": "pkg:deb/sonic/frr@<sonic-version>?arch=<arch>",
  "supplier": {"name": "SONiC build (forked upstream)"},
  "pedigree": {
    "ancestors": [{
      "name": "frr",
      "version": "<upstream-tag>",
      "purl": "pkg:github/FRRouting/frr@<upstream-tag>",
      "externalReferences": [{"type": "vcs", "url": "https://github.com/FRRouting/frr"}]
    }],
    "patches": [
      {"type": "unofficial",
       "diff": {"url": "file://src/sonic-frr/patch/<patch-name>.patch"},
       "resolves": [
         {"type": "security",
          "id": "CVE-YYYY-NNNNN",
          "references": ["https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-YYYY-NNNNN"]}
       ]}
    ],
    "notes": "patch-set sha256: <hex>"
  }
}
```

CycloneDX's `diff` object carries `url` and `text` and nothing else, so
each patch's SHA-256 is a component property rather than a `hashes`
array beside them:

```json
{"name": "sonic:patch_sha256", "value": "<hex>  <patch path>"}
```

Emitting it inside `diff` is what made every document this produced fail
`cyclonedx validate --input-version v1_6`, silently, because the tools we
happen to read it with are lenient about it.

`resolves[]` appears when a patch says which vulnerability it fixes —
by naming it in the patch filename, or in a `Fixes:` or `Subject:`
header. A CVE mentioned in passing elsewhere in the patch is not
recorded, because that is not the patch claiming to fix anything.

This matters for the forked-upstream pattern above. `ancestors[]`
honestly reports the older upstream version SONiC started from, so a
scanner reads that version and reports issues that a carried patch has
already fixed. Without `resolves[]` nothing in the SBOM distinguishes
those from the ones still outstanding.

## License resolution

Three sources, applied in priority order:

1. **Per-recipe override.** Recipes can declare
   `$(<artifact>)_LICENSE = "<SPDX expression>"` in `rules/*.mk`. The
   build helper passes it through to the fragment generator as
   `ARTIFACT_LICENSE`. Authoritative for SONiC-native packages where
   no `debian/copyright` ships.

2. **DEP-5 `debian/copyright`.** The build hook tars every
   `/usr/share/doc/*/copyright` from each scope into a sidecar
   tarball (before `apt autoremove` and the doc-strip at the end of
   the rootfs build wipe it). The resolver parses any file declaring
   `Format: ...copyright-format/1.0/` and maps `License:` stanzas
   to SPDX via `scripts/sbom_license_map.json` (~100 mappings).

3. **`licensecheck` fallback** (from `devscripts`) for non-DEP-5
   copyright files; output goes through the same SPDX table.

Components ending up `NOASSERTION` are counted at end-of-build:

```
[build_sbom.py] License resolution: 1182/1266 resolved (93.4%); 84 NOASSERTION
```

### Maintaining `scripts/sbom_license_map.json`

The license-header → SPDX-identifier map is **manually curated**. Each
entry maps a free-form license declaration string (as it appears in
`License:` stanzas of Debian DEP-5 `debian/copyright` files, or as
`licensecheck` reports them) to a valid SPDX-2.3 identifier.

To add a new mapping when a previously-unmapped `License:` keyword
shows up in a build's `NOASSERTION` set:

1. Run a build with `ENABLE_SBOM=y`. The aggregator logs the count
   of unresolved components: `License resolution: X/Y resolved …; N
   NOASSERTION`.
2. Drill into the generated `target/<artifact>.bin.cdx.json` and
   grep for components with no `licenses[]` entry; check their
   `pedigree.notes` or external references to find the source
   `License:` keyword the resolver couldn't match.
3. Look up the corresponding SPDX identifier at
   <https://spdx.org/licenses/>.
4. Add an entry to `scripts/sbom_license_map.json`:
   ```json
   "BSD-3-Clause variant from foo project": "BSD-3-Clause"
   ```
5. Re-run the build (or just the aggregator) and verify the count
   of resolved components increases.

The map is intentionally not auto-generated: false-positive risk is
too high for license declarations that differ in legally-meaningful
ways. A new mapping should be reviewed by someone who has read the
underlying license text at least once.

## Tools

When `ENABLE_SBOM=y`, the build invokes `scripts/install_sbom_tool.sh`
to fetch `syft`, `cyclonedx-cli` (if SPDX requested), and `grype` (for
post-build vuln scanning). The script wgets a pinned upstream release,
verifies its SHA-256 against a value hardcoded in the script, and
caches the binary under `target/sbom-tools/`. Subsequent builds use the
cache.

Because the `wget` runs through SONiC's existing build-hook shim, the
URL + MD5 lands in `versions-web` like every other web-fetched
artifact — no manual pin editing required.

For standalone vuln scanning outside a build, the same script
auto-fetches into `~/.cache/sonic-sbom/`.

The aggregator additionally caches per-file scanner output under
`target/sbom-tools/syft-cache/<tool>-<version>-<sha256>.json`, keyed by
SHA-256 of the input archive. The `<version>` is `SCANNER_CACHE_VERSION`
in `build_sbom.py`, bumped whenever a change alters what a scan returns
for unchanged input — the archive's digest cannot notice that we now
read it differently. Entries under a superseded version are left in
place rather than pruned; `make reset` clears them with the rest of
`target/`. A SONiC platform with multiple ASIC variants
(e.g. broadcom, broadcom-dnx, broadcom-legacy-th) invokes
`build_sbom.py` once per variant; without the cache, syft would
re-scan the ~28 docker `.gz` files that are identical across variants
three times. The cache short-circuits 2nd and 3rd hits. `dir:` scans
(host rootfs) are not cached because `fsroot-<machine>/` differs per
variant. `make reset` wipes `target/` and therefore invalidates the
cache automatically — no stale entries across resets.

The license resolver's output is similarly memoized so it is not
recomputed once per ASIC variant. Same `make reset` invalidation
as the scanner cache; transparent to operators.

## Reproducibility

Two byte-identical builds of the same source produce byte-identical
SBOMs. `Makefile.work` sets `SOURCE_DATE_EPOCH` automatically from
the HEAD git commit's author timestamp (falling back to wall-clock
`date +%s` only when the source tree isn't a git checkout), and
exports it through to the slave container, so all SBOM timestamps
are derived from source state rather than build wall-clock. Component
ordering is sorted. License resolution depends only on on-disk files
+ the static translation table. Override is supported by passing
`SOURCE_DATE_EPOCH=<unix-ts>` explicitly to `make`.

Cross-host reproducibility check:

```bash
python3 scripts/sbom_diff.py old-host.cdx.json new-host.cdx.json
# Exit 0 if equivalent at the component level; non-zero on drift.
# --quiet for one-line summary; --json out.json for tooling.
```

The diff ignores timestamps and aggregator-internal metadata. It
compares version, hashes, licenses, pedigree.ancestors, and patch
hashes.

Each SBOM carries a `serialNumber` derived from its own contents, so
two identical builds produce the same one and any change produces a
different one. CycloneDX suggests a fresh identifier per generation;
that is deliberately not done here, because it would retire the
guarantee above. The vulnerability report records the serial number of
the SBOM it was produced from, which is what ties the two documents
together once they have been copied away from the build tree.

## Attestation and signing

The build emits an **unsigned** SLSA v1.0 / in-toto v1 provenance at
`target/sonic-<machine>.bin.intoto.json` capturing the `.bin`
SHA-256, the `sonic-buildimage` git commit, the active build slave
image digests, the build's external parameters (`PLATFORM`,
`CONFIGURED_ARCH`, `INCLUDE_*`, etc.), and a content-hash reference to
the SBOM. The document is reproducible.

**No signing happens inside the build.** Two reasons: (1) SONiC's
`SECURE_UPGRADE_*` keys answer a different question ("permitted to
boot on this hardware?"); reusing them for attestation expands their
blast radius; (2) production signing often requires per-invocation
human approval — release engineering needs to batch all artifacts
under one key access in their own toolchain.

Recommended post-build workflow (operator chooses the tool):

```bash
# Sigstore cosign
cosign sign-blob --yes --key cosign.key \
    --output-signature target/sonic-broadcom.bin.cdx.json.sig \
    target/sonic-broadcom.bin.cdx.json

# Or OpenSSL PKCS#7
openssl cms -sign -binary -in target/sonic-broadcom.bin.cdx.json \
    -signer attestation.crt -inkey attestation.key \
    -outform DER -out target/sonic-broadcom.bin.cdx.json.p7s
```

## Vulnerability scanning

Decoupled from the build by design: the SBOM is reproducible, a CVE
report cannot be (new CVEs are disclosed daily). A six-month-old SBOM
can be re-scanned against today's CVE data without rebuilding.

Standalone Python scripts, not make targets:

```bash
# Default report (table + sibling .vuln.json)
python3 scripts/sbom_vuln_scan.py target/sonic-broadcom.bin.cdx.json

# With VEX suppression and CI gating
python3 scripts/sbom_vuln_scan.py --vex vex/ --fail-on critical \
    target/sonic-broadcom.bin.cdx.json

# Drift between two reports
python3 scripts/sbom_vuln_diff.py release-202503.vuln.json release-202504.vuln.json
```

The scanner (`grype` by default) reads the SBOM directly. Without
VEX, every locally-patched component flags upstream CVEs (since
`pedigree.ancestors` records the unpatched version). VEX suppresses
those that the SONiC patches actually fix.

The table written to stdout has one row per finding, sorted by
severity descending:

```
SEVERITY  ID                 ECOSYS  PKG                        VERSION                  STATE      FIX

```

`ECOSYS` is derived from the PURL type (`deb`, `rust`, `go`, `npm`,
`py`, `gem`, `java`, `oci`, `github`, `generic`). `FIX` is the
suggested upgrade version when grype's advisory data names one, or
`-` for `not-fixed` advisories. GHSA aliases for CVE-primary findings
are preserved in the sidecar `<report>.cdx.json` as
`vulnerabilities[].references[]` per the CycloneDX 1.6 schema.

### VEX

VEX files live in `vex/` as OpenVEX JSON (grype's `--vex` flag
rejects YAML). `vex/README.md` documents the schema, status taxonomy,
and triage workflow. Curated statements live at the top level and are
checked in; the `vex/auto/` subdirectory is **gitignored** and
regenerated on every SBOM build by `scripts/sbom_extract_vex_from_patches.py`,
which reads the patches SONiC maintains for CVE markers and emits a
`fixed` statement per CVE a patch declares. The regeneration is wired
into `scripts/build_sbom.sh` so the auto-VEX set always reflects the
current state of `src/*/patches/` — a patch that introduces or
removes a CVE marker is reflected on the very next build.
Re-invocations against an unchanged patch set short-circuit;
changing any tracked patch forces a rescan on the next build.

Which patches count is `sbom_cve_refs.patch_dirs()`, the same
function that decides what goes in a component's
`pedigree.patches[]` — so the SBOM and the VEX statements describe
one patch set rather than two that happen to agree. It is the
directories SONiC keeps its own patches in (`src/<pkg>.patch/`,
`src/<pkg>/patch/`, `src/<pkg>/patches/`,
`src/sonic-linux-kernel/patches-sonic/`), and within each, only the
entries its `series` lists. Notably **not** the patches carried by
the upstream sources the build unpacks: a Debian source under
`src/<pkg>/<pkg>-<version>/` brings its own `debian/patches/`, and
those fixes are Debian's and already present in the version we ship.
Reading them produced statements claiming "Fixed by SONiC local
patch" for changes SONiC did not make — 13 of 17 statements on one
broadcom build.

The status is `fixed`, not `not_affected`: the patch changed the
vulnerable code, so the artifact carries the fix even though its
version string still matches the vulnerable range. `not_affected`
would assert the code is untouched and merely unreachable, which is
a different claim. Both statuses suppress the finding in grype; the
report records the difference as `analysis.state` `resolved` versus
`not_affected`.

A finding a VEX statement covers is **kept in the vulnerability
report**, carrying an `analysis` block that records the suppression and
its justification. Dropping it would leave the finding simply absent —
with the component, its version and its pedigree all unchanged — which
is indistinguishable from a scan that failed. The `--fail-on` gate
still considers only findings that were not suppressed.

```json
{
  "@context": "https://openvex.dev/ns/v0.2.0",
  "@id": "https://github.com/sonic-net/sonic-buildimage/vex/<id>",
  "author": "<email>",
  "timestamp": "<ISO-8601>",
  "version": 1,
  "statements": [{
    "vulnerability": {"name": "CVE-YYYY-NNNNN"},
    "products": [{"@id": "pkg:deb/sonic/<name>@<version>"}],
    "status": "not_affected",
    "justification": "vulnerable_code_not_in_execute_path",
    "impact_statement": "Why this CVE does not apply to this build",
    "references": ["<upstream-commit-or-advisory-URL>"]
  }]
}
```

The example above is the curated shape. Auto-extracted entries use a
generic `pkg:generic/<source-tree>` PURL because the extractor
doesn't know which downstream debs the patch ships in. That PURL names
the source tree rather than a shipped package, and the components in
the document are `pkg:deb/...` and `pkg:github/...`, so unless one of
them happens to carry that exact name the statement matches nothing
at all — the risk is an auto statement that quietly suppresses
nothing, not one that suppresses too much. Promoting the entry to a
curated file with a concrete PURL is what makes it apply.

`vex/README.md`'s two-report recipe is how you check whether a given
statement took effect: a statement that matched moves a finding to
`Status changed:`, and one that matched nothing leaves both reports
identical.

## Verification

```bash
# Schema-validate the SBOM
cyclonedx-cli validate --input-file target/sonic-<machine>.bin.cdx.json

# Component count
jq '.components | length' target/sonic-<machine>.bin.cdx.json

# Locally-patched components
jq '.components[] | select(.pedigree.patches) | .name' \
    target/sonic-<machine>.bin.cdx.json

# Components without resolved licenses
jq '.components[] | select(.licenses == null or .licenses == []) | .name' \
    target/sonic-<machine>.bin.cdx.json
```

## Querying dependencies

The CycloneDX `dependencies[]` graph supports direct walks without
parsing string properties. The bom-ref of a SONiC-built `.deb`
matches its source identity — `pkg:github/sonic-net/<repo>@<commit>`
for components built from a sonic-net submodule,
`pkg:deb/sonic/<name>@<version>?arch=<arch>` for patched-upstream
Debian sources.

The graph is rooted at the image component, so a walk can start from
the top rather than from a package you already knew to look for.

```bash
SBOM=target/sonic-<machine>.bin.cdx.json

# Which containers does the image install?
jq -r --arg root "$(jq -r .metadata.component."bom-ref" $SBOM)" \
   '.dependencies[] | select(.ref == $root) | .dependsOn[]
    | select(startswith("pkg:oci/"))' $SBOM

# Which containers ship a given package? (the question you ask first
# when a finding lands: where does this actually run?)
jq -r --arg pkg "pkg:deb/debian/libc6@2.41-12" \
   '.dependencies[] | select(.dependsOn[]? == $pkg) | .ref' $SBOM

# What is inside one container?
jq -r --arg c "pkg:oci/docker-fpm-frr@..." \
   '.dependencies[] | select(.ref == $c) | .dependsOn[]' $SBOM
```

A component can appear under several containers — shared libraries
usually do — and its `sonic:scope` property lists every scope it was
observed in, space-separated. A component the build could not place is
left out of the containment edges rather than attached to the image on
the assumption that it must be somewhere; the aggregator logs how many
those were.

The image's direct children are the containers the installer actually
ships plus one `sonic:host-image` component, an `operating-system` node
standing for the switch's own filesystem — packages installed outside a
container hang off that rather than off the image, so the first question
anyone asks of the graph ("base system, or inside a container?") has an
answer. Every docker the build saves emits a fragment, test containers
included, so `target/` routinely holds fragments for containers that
are in no `.bin`; those are not rooted.

Code compiled into a program hangs off the program rather than off the
filesystem the program sits in. A Go module is not something an image
contains — it is linked into an executable, and the scanner already
records which one — so an `application` component is synthesized per
program per scope, named for its path, and the modules hang off that:
`host-image -> /usr/bin/containerd -> stdlib` rather than
`host-image -> stdlib`. On a broadcom build that is 1,774 module-to-program
attributions over 21 programs.

The pairing is made at scan time, not after the merge. syft emits one record
per (module, program) and they all carry the same package URL, so the dedupe
collapses them: it unions every record's scope but keeps only one record's
location. Paired afterwards, that one surviving path is handed every scope
the merge unioned in, which names programs inside containers that do not
ship them and leaves the containers' own programs unrecorded.

A location under `/var/lib/docker/overlay2/` is a container's own file seen
a second time through the host filesystem docker unpacked it into. No
program is named after it — the overlay directory name is regenerated by
every build, so a component hung off one would change identity between
builds and break the reproducible serial number promised above — and the
module is not attached to that filesystem either. The per-container scan
sees the same file at its real path and places it there; saying the base
system also contains it would assert that code only present inside a
container is installed on the switch.

It stops at the program. Which package ships that file is a better answer
still and is not in the document: the scanner runs with file metadata off,
so no component carries a file list, and guessing from the name would
attach a component to a package nobody observed shipping it. Only a
cataloger that reports code compiled into something else is treated this
way — a kernel module's recorded location is the module itself, and
re-parenting that would invent a program that does not exist.

What compiled the image is not what the image contains, so build-toolchain
components live in a top-level `formulation[]` section rather than in
`components[]`. Nothing is discarded — a build-chain compromise stays
answerable from the same document — but a consumer asking "what is in the
image" gets `components[]`, and one asking "what did we scan" has to read
both. CycloneDX treats a component with no `scope` as `required`, so
leaving them in `components[]` asserted the image contains its own
compiler.

Both of these change the shape of the document: a consumer that walked
`root -> dependsOn` to list host packages now finds them one level down,
and one that enumerated `components[]` to count what was scanned now
under-reports by whatever the toolchain contributed.

The finished graph is checked before the document is written: every
`dependsOn` target has to resolve to a component in the document or to
the root, nothing may depend on itself, and no container may be rooted
under an image that does not install it. Failures surface in the build
log and fail the build under `SBOM_STRICT=y`, the default; `SBOM_STRICT=n`
downgrades them to warnings along with the input checks.
Nothing downstream does this — `grype` reads `components[]` and ignores
the graph — so an unchecked document would ship its mistakes silently.

Tools that understand CycloneDX `dependencies[]` natively work
without any of these `jq` queries — e.g. `cyclonedx-cli analyze`,
or piping the SBOM into a graph visualizer. The examples above
exist for ad-hoc analysis from a shell.

## Known limitations

- **Per-.deb language dependency attribution is scoped to SONiC-
  built `.debs`.** `scripts/sbom_fragment.py` introspects each
  SONiC-built `.deb` and harvests Rust crates (from cargo-auditable
  `.dep-v0` ELF sections via `rust-audit-info`), Go modules (from
  `runtime/debug.BuildInfo` via `go version -m`), and Python
  distributions (from `*.dist-info/METADATA` walk). Components are
  scoped at the `.deb` level via `sonic:source_deb`, *not* per-binary
  within the `.deb`. Upstream Debian-archive `.debs` are intentionally
  out of scope — their language-dep metadata is captured by the syft
  scanner pass plus the observation manifests, not by `.deb`
  introspection.

- **`uv pip` skips the `pip3` build-hook shim**, so its installs are
  absent from the observation manifest. They still reach the SBOM via
  the scanner pass — uv writes standard `dist-info/` directories — but
  their `sonic:fragment_kind` property reads `scanner` rather than
  `observation`.

- **Vendored static libraries** statically linked into binaries (a
  `.deb` that bundles libcurl instead of dynamic-linking) are
  undetectable without source-code scanning. Not closed by this
  design.

- **Pip artifacts lack hashes** from pin time because SONiC's
  Python version-control doesn't use `--require-hashes`. The scanner
  may compute installation-time hashes from `RECORD` as a best-effort
  substitute.

- **Broadcom XGS SAI** historically used `_SKIP_VERSION=y`. The SBOM
  computes SHA-256 of the downloaded artifact independently and
  ignores the recipe flag.

- **Vendor EULA license names** are recorded as declared (e.g.,
  "Broadcom Inc. proprietary (EULA)") but not normalised to SPDX
  expressions, since most are not SPDX-listed.

Files that exist for this design.

| Path | Role |
|---|---|
| `rules/config` | Defines the four SBOM configuration variables. |
| `Makefile.work` | Threads SBOM variables into the slave-container environment. |
| `slave.mk` | Defines the `sbom_emit_fragment` helper, calls it from each `SONIC_*` artifact recipe, invokes `build_sbom.sh` between rootfs assembly and `.bin` wrap, and exposes the recipe context (installer docker/deb/wheel lists) to the aggregator. |
| `build_image.sh` | Emits the `.cdx.json` sibling after the `.bin` is wrapped. |
| `scripts/install_sbom_tool.sh` | Auto-fetches syft, grype, cyclonedx-cli with SHA-256 verify into `target/sbom-tools/`. |
| `scripts/build_sbom.py` | Aggregator. Walks fragments, runs the scanner, parses lockfiles, resolves licenses, dedupes, builds and validates the CycloneDX `dependencies[]` graph (containment: image → the host filesystem and the containers it installs → packages; kernel-module → kernel-image edges; declared `.deb` build/runtime deps; recipe-emit-{rust,go,python} → owning `.deb` edges), and writes the SBOM + SPDX + provenance. |
| `scripts/build_sbom.sh` | Thin shim that execs `build_sbom.py`. |
| `scripts/sbom_fragment.py` | Per-recipe fragment generator. Knows the four ancestor patterns, the vendor-supplier URL table, and the per-`.deb` language-dep harvesters (Rust via `rust-audit-info`, Go via `go version -m`, Python via `*.dist-info/METADATA` walk). |

| `scripts/sbom_license_map.json` | ~100 Debian License header strings mapped to SPDX. |
| `scripts/sbom_parse_lockfiles.py` | Parses `go.sum`, `package-lock.json`, `pnpm-lock.yaml`, `yarn.lock` from harvested archives. Also parses `Cargo.lock` defensively for legacy archives — but Rust attribution comes from `sbom_fragment.py`'s `.dep-v0` introspection, not from this parser. |
| `scripts/sbom_emit_provenance.py` | Emits the unsigned SLSA v1.0 / in-toto provenance document. |

| `scripts/sbom_cve_refs.py` | Which patches the build applies, and the CVEs each claims to fix. Shared by `sbom_fragment.py` and `sbom_extract_vex_from_patches.py` so the SBOM and the VEX statements cannot disagree about either. |
| `scripts/sbom_extract_vex_from_patches.py` | Auto-VEX from CVE markers in patch metadata. |
| `vex/` | OpenVEX statements (curated at top level, auto in `vex/auto/`). |
